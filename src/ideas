lots of little processors cooperating to create and update a model

trying to reverse engineer the input I am receiving


each module is trying to create a model that can generate and predict its input
submodels predict small parts
parent models predict larger parts combining smaller
predict the input based on what though?
based on the time or an ongoing series?

based on some secondary input that


maybe just an input and an output
the input is which direction it is looking
and the output is what the sensors receive
